# Tree phenology


If we consider fruit trees, their annual cycle can generally be described relatively easily. Starting in autumn, it is observed that almost all fruit trees shed their leaves and go into winter without foliage. Already in the autumn, the formation of the bud can often be observed. This bud then remains in a kind of winter dormancy throughout the winter and begins to grow with increasing temperatures in the spring. This process is usually followed by the flowering of the fruit trees with subsequent leaf development. Later in the year, fruits establish themselves from the buds, which mature at different times of the year.
But how does the tree know when it can begin flowering induction and no longer expect strong frost?
This can be described with the concept of dormancy. This can be divided into 4 phases.

**Tree dormancy**

 - Dormancy establishment
 - Endodormancy
 - Ecodormancy
 - Growth resumption
 
 
 
**Dormacy establishment**

 - Controlled by tempeature and photoperiod. 

**Endodormancy**

- Controlled by plant endogenous factors. Plants unable to growth even under 
  favorable environmental conditions. 

**Ecodormancy**

 - After a certain level of chill, endodormancy has been overcome and buds recover the capacity to grow. Trees become acclimated to freezing tolerance and are not deeply dormant, but growth is still prevented by unsuitable environmental conditions. Temperature is the most important driver in this process.
