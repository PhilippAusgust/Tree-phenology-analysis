# Introduction

In this learning Logbook, all units from the Tree phenology analysis with R module are documented. In addition to the tasks set at the end of each learning unit, this work is supplemented with additional materials and analyses. This is done using weather data taken from my own weather station. The corresponding data can be found at the following link: <https://wettermuehle.de>.  Access data can be requested if desired.
